### SWDV691 - Software Development Capstone

Time Detective is a web application which allows you to decide on important recurring tasks and track how much time you spend on each one. The application will provide summary statistics as well as allow the user to perform more detailed analytics about how they are spending their time.

This web application is my final project for my Master's in Software Development from Maryville University.

### Prerequisites
This backend service application is dependent on PostgreSQL and requires users and tables to be set up according to [SQL script](time_detective.sql)

This repository is the backend service layer of the application. It requires the front-end user interface at [SWDV619 - UI](https://github.com/mikecolbert2/SWDV691-UI) to be installed and running to interact with the applicatiton.
